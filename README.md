## Inspiration
 Traditional banking required so much centralization in hands of the bank. Banks acted as a mediator between the lender and the borrower and in return, levied high-interest rates as per their will.  DeBank is a unique platform connecting people and it serves as a permissionless and cheap protocol that democratizes borrowing and lending which allows you to make the most of your capital.


 

## What it does

    People can also stake their portfolio with DeBank and in return, will be offered special airdrops.

    With DeBank, it provides the opportunity for the borrower to cut back the rate of interest by providing a free choice to stake their collateral on our platform. Collaterals could be anything, even in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs).

    being hosted on the Solana network DeBank ensures the security and provides transparency of each and every transaction with a unique hash ID that can be accessed by any user. It also provides extremely cheap and fast transactions, as compared to other blockchain networks,
 



## Challenges we ran into
Our team believes that behind each and every successful task there are some difficulties which we tend to overcome merrily, Time Constraint was one of the major challenges faced by us, along with the technical difficulties faced by us in integrating Solana into our project.
